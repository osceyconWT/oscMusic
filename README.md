# oscMusic - the easy, terminal-based music player
### what?
oscMusic is a terminal-based music player written in Python.<br>
### why?
i created oscMusic because, well, i couldn't find a good music player. every music player i found was either INCREDIBLY outdated, or didn't work well with my linux distribution. (Pop_OS + KDE Plasma)<br>
### how?
you can use oscMusic by doing the following:<br>
install python on your system at [Python's official homepage](python.org)<br>
depending on your operating system, follow these steps:<br>
#### Windows:
run the following commands inside of Command Prompt after installing Python:<br>
"pip install mutagen"<br>
"pip install pygame"<br>
you can now run the program:<br>
"python {filename}"<br>
#### Linux:
for the most common distro, Ubuntu/Ubuntu-based distros:<br>
run these commands in your terminal:<br>
"sudo apt install python3-mutagen"<br>
"sudo apt install python3-pygame"<br>
then you can run the code:<br>
"python3 {filename}"<br>
if you're using any other distro i assume you're smart enough to adapt it to your distro yourself<br>
### Mac:
run these commands in your terminal:<br>
"pip install mutagen"<br>
"pip install pygame"<br>
you can now run the program:<br>
"python {filename}"<br>
