# oscMusic - the easy, terminal-based music player
### what?
oscMusic is a terminal-based music player written in Python.
### why?
i created oscMusic because, well, i couldn't find a good music player. every music player i found was either INCREDIBLY outdated, or didn't work well with my linux distribution. (Pop_OS + KDE Plasma)
### how?
you can use oscMusic by doing the following:
install python on your system at [Python's official homepage](python.org)
depending on your operating system, follow these steps:
#### Windows:
run the following commands inside of Command Prompt after installing Python:
"pip install mutagen"
"pip install pygame"
you can now run the program:
"python {filename}"
#### Linux:
for the most common distro, Ubuntu/Ubuntu-based distros:
run these commands in your terminal:
"sudo apt install python3-mutagen"
"sudo apt install python3-pygame"
then you can run the code:
"python3 {filename}"
if you're using any other distro i assume you're smart enough to adapt it to your distro yourself
### Mac:
run these commands in your terminal:
"pip install mutagen"
"pip install pygame"
you can now run the program:
"python {filename}"
